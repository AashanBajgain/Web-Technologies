            <p>Hello, I'm Aashan Bjgain.I was born on November 7, 2003 in a city called Itahari which lies in the eastern part of Nepal. I finished my +2 from Nepal Apf College situated in Kirtipur-4, Kathmandu, Nepal. I was a science student but had an intense desire in learning about the computer system. So, I chose IT as a field to pursue my career and joined Herald College Kathmandu.</p>
